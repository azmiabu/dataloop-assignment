In this assignment we added pictures to the DL platform, we added some labels and associated them to the corresponding pictures.

In part I we did so using the UI:
* at first we add all the pictures to the platform
* to add a labels to the dataset we need to first create a recipe and add all the labels to it.
* to associate a label to a picture you need to choose the desired picture by double clicking on it, then choose at least one of the annotation tools
  on the bottom left side of the screen and then choose the desired label
* if you wish to add an attribute, go to the recipe screen and create a section, add the desired labels to the section and add as many attributes as 
  you like, those attributes will be available for the added labels/scopes

In part 2 we did the same thing using python code, it is very helpful to use the DL cheat sheet: https://dataloop.ai/docs/sdk-cheatsheet?highlight=cheat
